/*
 * hn is short fot Home Network here.
 * Not to be confused with Ethernet.
 * This will be kind of like a very cut down and slow CAN network. So there will be no need for network hardware.
 *
 * Lets go with:
 * 1: A pull down pulse to say I am about to start sending.
 * 2: Then 8 bits of data
 * 3: Then a parity. Also makes it so each 9 bits + parity(10 bits total) sent have to have at least 1 each of having the line HIGH and LOW.
 * 4: For now use extra bit for expecting acknowledgement back, OK RESEND etc.
 * 5: TODO Maybe do checksums
 * 6: Todo: should probably use CAN style, add a inverted bit if long sequence of high or low bits instead of relying on parity bit.
